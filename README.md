# Clues â€” Midnight Society
### https://filipemanuelofs.github.io/12am-clues/
This unofficial website was created to gather information found in the alternate reality game (ARG) by [Midnight Society Studio](https://www.midnightsociety.com/). The game is played on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/midnight-society).

This static website was created using HTML5, custom CSS and Bootstrap. As the site uses a timeline reference with the resources found in the game, the lazy loading attribute is heavily used in rendered images.
